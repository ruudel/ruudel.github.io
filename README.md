This is school project that help to learn about GRAPHQL.

[Live Server](https://kristjanl1.github.io/)

## Project goals

The objective of this project is to learn the GraphQL query language, by creating your own profile page.

You'll use the GraphQL endpoint which is provided by the platform (<https://01.kood.tech/api/graphql-engine/v1/graphql>). You'll be able to query your own data to populate your profile page.

So that you can access your data, you'll need to create a login page.

Your profile must display three pieces of information which you may choose. For example:

- Basic user identification
- XP amount
- grades
- audits
- skills

Beside those sections it will have a mandatory section for the generation of statistic graphs.
